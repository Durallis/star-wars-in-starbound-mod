Furious Koala*\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n#### Gear Mod Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Remove any existing **StarWarsGearMod** folders from the mod directory of your Starbound installation.\r\n2. Copy entire **StarWarsGearMod** folder to the mod directory of your Starbound installation.\r\n3. Craft the Star Wars Workbench.\r\n4. Craft Items at the Star Wars Workbench.\r\n\r\n#### Race Mods Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Install the [Simple Extended Character Creation Mod](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/simple-extended-character-creation-mod-now-even-easier.218/)\r\n2. In the extracted zip file, navigate to the \"races\" folder.\r\n3. Copy the folders of the races you wish to install to your Mods folder.\r\n4. You're done!\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n**0.5.2b** - Bothans & Bugfixes - *1/27/14*\r\n\r\n* Added Bothan species beta.  Emotes need work, so do some hairstyles - but you can achieve some neat things with those in there now.\r\n* Fixed unnecessary merge happening in the race treasure pools that was giving some users grief.\r\n* Fixed another conflict that occurred with certain other race mods.\r\n\r\n**0.5.1b** - Twi'lek's are back, yo. - *1/27/14*\r\n\r\n**0.5b** - The Beginning of Tiered Gear - *1/27/14*\r\n\r\n**Major Change to Crafting**\r\n\r\n**Most** *(read: not all... yet)* items are no longer crafted for 1 pixel and now are assigned recipes that place them squarely in, or near, tiers 1-7.  We're going to see how this goes, but hopefully it's become a bit more rewarding to create and use the items now.\r\n\r\nCurrently the items themselves have remained **solely vanity items.**  Within the next week, expect all gear added to the mod to have specs comparable to the tier in which you craft it.\r\n\r\n**To Users Who Want the gear for Free (or 1 pixel)**\r\n\r\nI realize the increased cost for crafting may turn some players off.  For the sake of those who would prefer to have access to all items, all the time, I recommend the [Creative Mode Mod by aMannus](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/creative-mode-complete-control-over-your-experience-angry-koala.614/), which is what I use for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\n* Force Crush power reduced dramatically.\r\n* Further file hierarchy changes.\r\n\r\n**0.4b** - Furious Koala Compatibility Update - *1/26/14*\r\n\r\n**Additions**\r\n\r\n* Now Compatible with Furious Koala\r\n\r\nFingers crossed that this means no more wipes!\r\n\r\n* Star Wars Workbench\r\n\r\nUnified crafting station for all content in the Star Wars Gear Mod moving forward. \r\n\r\n* Tabula Rasa Support\r\n\r\nSupport for the Tabula Rasa unified crafting bench.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n* Minor Change to Chewbacca Sprite, more coming shortly.\r\n* Minor Update to Snowtrooper Sprite.\r\n* Major file hierarchy and name convention changes to clean up some badly organized early items.\r\n\r\n**Removed**\r\n\r\n* Twi'Lek Race removed temporarily until both the Twi'lek mod and Extended Character Creation mod are updated for Furious Koala.\r\n\r\n**0.3.1b** - Two New Armor Sets - *1/25/14*\r\n\r\n**Added**\r\n\r\n* Chewbacca Costume\r\n* Snowtrooper Armor Set\r\n\r\n**0.3b** - The First Race Addition - *1/24/14*\r\n\r\nAdded new playable race: **Twi'Lek**\r\n\r\nThe first race addition in its early stages.  More skin/lekku colors to come, as well as more lekku styles.  Includes starter Vibroblade.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Requires the [Simple Extended Character Creation Mod](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/simple-extended-character-creation-mod-now-even-easier.218/)\r\n\r\n**Installation Instructions**\r\n\r\nThe Star Wars race mods exist independent of the gear mod.  Once you have installed the Simple Extended Character Creation mod, simply extract the downloaded zip and browse to the \"races\" folder and simply copy the folders of the races you desire to add to your Mods directory.\r\n\r\nInstallation of the Star Wars Gear Mod remains the same.\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\n\r\n* Added Sandtrooper Chestpiece\r\n\r\n**0.2.5b** - Add Imperial Officers Clothing (Gray and Black) - *1/21/14*\r\n\r\n**0.2.4b** - Add Zam Wessel Armor, Updated Princess Leia Armor - *1/21/14*\r\n\r\n**0.2.3b** - Republic Commando, Force Crush, Sprite Polish - *1/19/14*\r\n\r\n**Added**\r\n\r\n* Republic Commando Armor Set\r\n* \"Force Crush\" item (MetalworkStation, Weapons Cat) [Functions the same as the Matter Manipulator - just more Forcier!]\r\n\r\n**Updated**\r\n\r\nAdjusted the helmet position of several trooper sprites including:\r\n\r\n* Storm Trooper\r\n* Captain Rex\r\n* Commander Cody\r\n\r\n\r\n**0.2.2b** - Three New Armor Sets, Updated Mandalore/Stormtrooper - *1/18/14*\r\n\r\n**Added**\r\n\r\n* Slave Leia\r\n* Commander Cody\r\n* Captain Rex\r\n\r\n**Updated**\r\n\r\n* Mandalore (Chest)\r\n* Stormtrooper (Minor)\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n\r\n* Removed some file bloat (unneeded frames files)\r\n\r\n**0.2.1b** - Two new sprites, force lightning added - *1/16/14*\r\n\r\n* Added force lightning.  Very early version, basically a \"gun\" that shoots lightning from your fingers.\r\n* Tweaked Speeder Bike speed down to help with slow map loads. May still need to be reduced.\r\n* Added Darth Sidious Robes.\r\n* Added Starkiller (TFU) Robes.\r\n\r\n**0.2b** - The Tech Update [Details Below] - *1/14/14*\r\n\r\nNow more than just a vanity armor set - Speeder Bikes and Jetpacks added!\r\n\r\nBoth pieces of tech are obtained by crafting their chips at the metalwork station and then using them.\r\n\r\n**Important Note:**  \r\nCurrently the jetpack tech functions basically the same as any other booster tech.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to add the sprites for the jetpack itself (read: you still have to have the Mandalorian jetpack back item for it to look like you are wearing a jetpack).\r\n\r\nThe next planned update to this mod will likely come **after** the next (and final) character wipe, and will remove the non-functioning jetpack from the crafting inventory.  I've run into issues with corrupted character files when removing items from the mod, and want everyone to be aware those are the reasons both still exist - but the goal here is to have this sorted out so there's no risk of this after the \"final wipe.\"\r\n\r\nMy hope is to have it ready to go as soon as the next patch hits (read: done before).\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.9b** - Added Princess Leia Armor Set v1 *(1/11/14)*\r\n\r\n*Note: A Fix was applied in version 0.1.8b that hopefully addresses some problems players were experiencing with beta recipes not being unlockable.*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.8b** - Added Revan Armor Set v1 *(1/10/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.7b** - Sprite Updates *(1/8/14)*\r\n\r\n* All new sprites for Stormtrooper Armor\r\n* New Helmet/Pants Sprites for Scout Trooper\r\n* New Helmet/Chest/Pants Sprites for Jango Fett\r\n* New Helmet Sprite for Mandalore the Ultimate\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.6b** - Several Changes *(1/6/14)*\r\n\r\n* New Sprite for Vader Helmet\r\n* Updated Sprite for Boba Fett\r\n* Updated Sprite for Jango Fett\r\n* Minor Update to Scout Trooper Pants\r\n* All recipes now must be crafted at the MetalWork Station to remove clutter from the crafting interface\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.5b** - Added Vader Armor Set *(1/5/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.4b** - Added Smuggler Clothes, Jedi & Sith Robes, and updated Stormtrooper Sprites *(1/4/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.3b** - Added Scout Armor Set, Updated Stormtrooper armor set. *(1/2/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.2b** - Added Stormtrooper armor set. *(1/1/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1.1b** - Added Boushh armor set. *(1/1/14)*\r\n\r\n**v 0.1b** - Initial Release\r\n\r\n## Current Roster\r\n\r\n* Boba Fett\r\n* Jango Fett\r\n* Mandalore the Ultimate\r\n* Boushh (Leia's Bounty Hunter Costume from Return of the Jedi)\r\n* Stormtrooper\r\n* Scout Trooper\r\n* Han Solo (Clothes)\r\n* Jedi Robes\r\n* Sith Robes\r\n* Darth Vader\r\n* Revan\r\n* Princess Leia\r\n* Starkiller\r\n* Darth Sidious\r\n* Slave Leia\r\n* Commander Cody\r\n* Captain Rex\r\n* Republic Commando\r\n* Imperial Officers Clothing (Gray and Black)\r\n* Snowtrooper\r\n* Chewbacca Costume\r\n\r\n## Requests\r\n\r\nRequests may be submitted via private message on the Starbound forums or via the contact form at [RainBeefJeff.com](http://rainbeefjeff.com).\r\n\r\nRequests do not guarantee a character addition, but I hope to be able to add as many as possible over time.\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n* Current sprites may change dramatically over time.\r\n* New character additions will come at whatever pace I can manage to get them added.\r\n* Current items are **vanity items only** - crafting requirements may be set further down the road once the Starbound economy has finalized.\r\n\r\n### Licensing:\r\n\r\nThe graphic assets of the this package may not be reproduced as part of any other published mod or conversion without the express written consent of the author.
